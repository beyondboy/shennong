Command line interface
======================

.. note::

   *Shennong* provides the ``speech-features`` program available from
   the command line.

   * It is a wrapper on the :ref:`features extraction pipeline
     <features_pipeline>` module.

   * The program is largely self-documented, the above documentation
     is simply the content of ``speech-features --help``


.. automodule:: bin.speech_features
