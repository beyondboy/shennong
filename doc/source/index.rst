* Shennong is a **toolbox for unsupervised speech recognition**.

* It provides both a **Python API** and a **command line interface**.

* It aims to provide three blocks of processing, inspired by the `Zero
  Resource Speech challenges <http://www.zerospeech.com/>`_:

  * Speech features extraction,
  * Subword modeling,
  * Spoken term discovery.

.. note::

   The package is still in development phase (current version is
   |version|):

    * Release *0.1* includes the *features* block,
    * Release 0.2 will include the *subword modeling* block,
    * Release *0.3* will include the *term discovery* block,
    * Further versions will include complete recipes, replication of
      published results and additional models.
